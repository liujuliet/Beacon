# Beacon

An iOS app that allows someone to turn off kitchen appliances remotely if the system doesn't detect a human in the room after a period of time has elapsed while the device is still powered on.

User interface:

The app would send the user a push notification through IFTTT if the motion sensors have not been triggered after a certain amount of time, encouraging the user to either shut off their appliance (by tapping the "Power" button) or dismiss the alert if they intentionally left the applicance on (by tapping the "Pause" button).
